    **The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) has been approved by the MHRD and launched by Honorable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September, 2015. This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations and broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover ""Teaching, Learning and Resources"", ""Research and Professional Practices"", ""Graduation Outcomes"", ""Outreach and Inclusivity"" and ""Perception"". NIRF has been given the responsibility of ranking institutions that have applied and submitted their data. The ranking of the Institutions will be done based on the parameters proposed by NIRF for different disciplines. The detailed parameters and calculations are available on the NIRF portal at [NIRF Web Site](https://www.nirfindia.org/Home)**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) has been approved by the MHRD and launched by Honorable Minister of Human Resource Development on 29th September, 2015. This framework outlines a methodology to rank institutions across the country. The methodology draws from the overall recommendations and broad understanding arrived at by a Core Committee set up by MHRD, to identify the broad parameters for ranking various universities and institutions. The parameters broadly cover ""Teaching, Learning and Resources"", ""Research and Professional Practices"", ""Graduation Outcomes"", ""Outreach and Inclusivity"" and ""Perception"". NIRF has been given the responsibility of ranking institutions that have applied and submitted their data. The ranking of the Institutions will be done based on the parameters proposed by NIRF for different disciplines. The detailed parameters and calculations are available on the NIRF portal at NIRF Web Site
